# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles that converts XFCE4's UI into basically 
9x UI.

This is just basically a forked version of Chicago95 with my own modifications with icons, etc being nabbed from other sources.
Disclaimer: My ig fork of Chicago95 will probably not support anything but my configuration, so don't expect me doing other DEs

Dependencies: icewm, xfce4, gtk3-classic, libxfce4ui-nocsd.
Optional Dependencies: rofi, dunst, kitty.
