# dotfiles
Linux themes etc for my personal system.

Conversion? My personal dotfiles that converts XFCE4's UI into basically 
Windows 2000 / 9x UI.

Some extra configs too for dunst, kitty, etc.

Will probably update this repo as I go.

GTK theme is basically a forked version of Chicago95 with my own modifications with icons, etc being nabbed from other sources.
