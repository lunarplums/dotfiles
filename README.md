# dotfiles
Linux themes etc for my personal system.

Conversion? My personal dotfiles that converts XFCE4's UI into basically 
Windows 2000 / 9x UI.

Some extra configs too for dunst, kitty, etc.

Will probably update this repo as I go.

GTK theme is basically a forked version of Chicago95 with my own modifications with icons, etc being nabbed from other sources.

Disclaimer: My ig fork of Chicago95 will probably not support anything but my configuration, so don't expect me doing Gnome, Mate, etc.
